Waveguide is a modular framework for analyzing and designing topological waveguides for quantum computing. It couples Liouvillian analytics with Stim-based circuit simulations and GPU-accelerated solvers. Jupyter demos showcase the theory behind our impedance-graded rings, cat-code drains, and photonic-phononic shells. The repository also hosts mask-layout files and COMSOL models for hardware implementation. A Sphinx manual compiles design notes and references. Everything is tested with pytest and built in CI with GitHub Actions. Data files are stored with Git LFS. Contribute ideas via pull requests or issues; the MIT license encourages broad academic use. Examples highlight noise models and parameter optimisation strategies.
